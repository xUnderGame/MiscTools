# UG's Misc Tools
A collections of random tools, usually Python and Bash scripts that I do for fun or Homework, free to use!

## BadEncryptor
It ""encrypts"" any text given by adding random text between the characters with a modifiable amount of characters, very easy to bruteforce. (bad)

## Add17Inator
Adds 17 to any set of numbers. (bad)

Can use normal numbers, Hexadecimals and Decimals.

## Guest-Prefs
This script was made for **an actual productive use** and it serves the purpose of making the setup of a "Guest User" in Debian 11 Bullseye *without using Gnome* (very specific). You need to have LightDM installed and set up with a user created and a free group that will be assigned to the guest.

All what the script does is generate a script every time the guest user shuts down the computer, all of the randomly generated users will dissapear. Aswell as creating a service to run automatically. 

Finally, it can disable "harmful" apps that the guest user could use to break havoc on the PC, like the terminals menu editing software or connection managers.

Sadly the script is only in **Spanish** as of now, it might be translated in the future if I feel like it

## CommaSpaces
Detects wether you left a space after a comma or a dot, if you forgot it will mark your error. (bad)
